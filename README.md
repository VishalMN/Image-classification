Introduction

Indian Movie Face database (IMFDB) is a large unconstrained face database consisting of 34512 images of 100 Indian actors collected from more than 100 videos. All the images are manually selected and cropped from the video frames resulting in a high degree of variability interms of scale, pose, expression, illumination, age, resolution, occlusion, and makeup. IMFDB is the first face database that provides a detailed annotation of every image in terms of age, pose, gender, expression and type of occlusion that may help other face related applications.
